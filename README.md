HW4-Problem-2
=============

<p><b>
Distribution of primes modulo n. 
Let n=15. (1) Plot a frequency histogram (stats.TimeSeries([1,2,3]).plot_histogram()) that 
shows how the prime numbers up to 10^7 are distributed modulo n. (stats.TimeSeries has a nice histogram method). 
(2) Make a conjecture based on your data. 
(3) Obtain data for other values of n and make a more general conjecture. (This is known as Dirichlet's theorem.)

<b>2) Conjecture Based on data</b>
<p>
I conjecture that there exist infinitely many primes of the form j+15k  where k is an integer and j and 15 are relatively prime.

<b>3) Obtain data for other values of n and make a more general conjecture.</b>
<p>
If we look at the histograms for n=10 and especially n=13 we can see the same behavior: <br>
