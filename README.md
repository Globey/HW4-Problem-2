HW4-Problem-2
=============

<p>
Distribution of primes modulo n. 
Let n=15. (1) Plot a frequency histogram (stats.TimeSeries([1,2,3]).plot_histogram()) that 
shows how the prime numbers up to 10^7 are distributed modulo n. (stats.TimeSeries has a nice histogram method). 
(2) Make a conjecture based on your data. 
(3) Obtain data for other values of n and make a more general conjecture. (This is known as Dirichlet's theorem.)
